# language-translator-using-IoT
A smart IoT-based system that translates hand gestures from sign language into text and speech. Using flex sensors to detect finger movements, the device identifies specific gestures and converts them into words, which are then displayed and spoken, enabling real-time communication for the hearing impaired.
